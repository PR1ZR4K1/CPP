//  (Arithmetic) Write a program to calculate how much square feet of surface area you need in order to paint the walls of a room that is X feet in length, Y feet in width, and Z feet in height. Write a program that does the following:
//     a. Ask the user the dimensions of the room in feet in all three dimensions (X, Y, Z).
//     b. Calculate the surface area of the of the four walls of the room (excluding the floor and the ceiling; you donâ€™t intend to paint those.)
//     c. Return the surface area to the user in Feet cubed.
//     d. Run for the following test cases:
//         i. X=10, Y=11, Z=12
//         ii. X=9, Y=9, Z=8
